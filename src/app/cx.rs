//! Per-frame / per-event context.
//!
//! Bundles the handful of shell-owned handles that model `apply`/`tick`
//! methods (and, in Phase 1, component `view`/`update`) need every frame:
//! the [`Timeline`], the current instant, and the rebuild token. Threading
//! one `&mut Cx` replaces passing `timeline`/`now`/`rebuild` as separate
//! params everywhere.
//!
//! The [`Worker`] is deliberately **not** in here: the frame loop drains
//! it with `while let Some(r) = worker.poll()` while passing `&mut Cx`
//! into the handler, so keeping the worker a separate borrow avoids a
//! self-borrow conflict (and it's a cheap `Rc` to thread alongside).
//!
//! [`Worker`]: crate::worker::Worker
